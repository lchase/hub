  * npm -g install npm@next

windows build tools (as admin console)
  * npm install --global --production windows-build-tools

Make sure to install python (probably not necessary, should be in the windows build tools)
  * 2.x (3.x doesn't work for some dependencies)
  * via https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.12/python-2.7.12.amd64.msi
  * Make sure you add the option to add python to the system path or you need to do it manually.
  * If it doesn't show up in your path you can kill explorer.exe and launch it vs. rebooting.
