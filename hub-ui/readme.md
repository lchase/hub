# General
* "npm install" - installs all dependencies including webpack
* "npm start" - Builds the UI module and starts the webpack development server,
which also monitors changes to source files and auto-deploys them.
* Navigate to "http://localhost:4001/webpack-dev-server/". NOTE: make sure hub-api
is running before you do this, otherwise it won't work.
* "npm test" - runs unit tests


# Todo
* Implement validation logic for create dashboard
* Wire up backend calls for dashboard (api needed as well)
* Sort out dashboard grid and how that would be stored then implement that
* Figure out how users pick shared dashboards or share private dashboards and view multiple dashboards

# Misc
